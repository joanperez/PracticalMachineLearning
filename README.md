# Practical Machine Learning Project
One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, the goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.
The project needs to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. We may use any of the other variables to predict with. We should create a report describing how we built our model, how we used cross validation, what we think the expected out of sample error is, and why we made the choices we did. We will also use our prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.

## Executive Summary  
Using devices such as JawboneUp, NikeFuelBand, and Fitbitit is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.
We will use data from `accelerometers` on the `belt`, `forearm`, `arm`, and `dumbell` of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the [website](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har) (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

## Data
The training data for this project are available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv). The test data are available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv). 
The data for this project come from this [source](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har). If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment.

## Expected Results
1. Our submission should consist of a link to a Github repo with your R markdown and compiled HTML file describing your analysis. Please constrain the text of the writeup to < 2000 words and the number of figures to be less than 5. It will make it easier for the graders if we submit a repo with a gh-pages branch so the HTML page can be viewed online.
2. We should also apply our machine learning algorithm to the 20 test cases available in the test data above. We will submit our predictions in appropriate format to the programming assignment for automated grading.

## Machine Learning Model For Predictions
1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forests
